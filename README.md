*Data is our new god* - Cosmos

Tracker is an Android app that is intended to help you track *every single minute of your day*. Right now, it is simply an interface to allow you to append a custom formatted log line to a file with a button press.

When it is complete (soon), it will generate cool visualizations based on the logged entries and have an Android watch interface.
